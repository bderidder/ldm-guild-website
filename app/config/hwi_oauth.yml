    # an optional setting to configure a query string parameter which can be used to redirect
    # the user after authentication, e.g. /connect/facebook?_destination=/my/destination will
    # redirect the user to /my/destination after facebook authenticates them.  If this is not
    # set then the user will be redirected to the original resource that they requested, or
    # the base address if no resource was requested.  This is similar to the behaviour of
    # [target_path_parameter for form login](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/cookbook/security/form_login.html).
    # target_path_parameter: _destination

    # an optional setting to use the HTTP REFERER header to be used in case no
    # previous URL was stored in the session (i.e. no resource was requested).
    # This is similar to the behaviour of
    # [using the referring URL for form login](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/cookbook/security/form_login.html#using-the-referring-url).

    # here you will add one (or more) configurations for resource owners
