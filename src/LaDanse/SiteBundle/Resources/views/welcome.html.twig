    <h2>Recently added events</h2>

    <p>Events that have been added in the last 7 days and haven't passed yet. On selection of an event, for which
       the user hasn't signed up yet, the user navigates to a
       sign up page: <a href="{{ path('createSignUpIndex') }}">sign up</a>. Guests can only see the events, they
       cannot sign up.</p>

    <h2>My sign ups</h2>

    <p>Guests cannot see this section at all. If the user is not a guest, a list of sign ups is shown. On
       selection of a sign up, the user navigates to a  page with more detail:
       <a href="{{ path('viewSignUpIndex') }}">view sign up</a>.</p>

    <h2>Other actions on this page</h2>

    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ path('viewEventsIndex') }}">Events</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{ path('mySettingsIndex') }}">My settings</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{ path('viewSignUpsIndex') }}">My sign ups</a></li>
