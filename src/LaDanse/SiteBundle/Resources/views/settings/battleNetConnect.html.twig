    <p>Enter a new password. Make sure the password is sufficiently strong, we will check that for you!</p>

    <p>We encourage you to use a Password Manager to automatically generate a strong password and help
    remembering it for you. <a href="{{ path('redirect', {'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers' }) }}" target="_blank">Here is a list of password managers</a>.</p>

    <p>For your own safety we strongly discourage you to use a password you also use on other sites. If this
       site ever would get hacked it is your responsibility if your other accounts on those sites are also hacked!</p>
